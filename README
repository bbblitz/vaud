vaud is a simple audio vizualizer written in ncureses for JACK,
I wrote it because I could find no good alternative.

To use, you MUST have the JACK server running,
got under "connect" and connect vaud to whichever process you need.

Additionally, color customization can be found the in config.h file.
YOU NEED TO RECOMPILE FOR COLORS TO APPLY.
